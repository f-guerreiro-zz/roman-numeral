# roman-numeral
 desafio Zenvia

Used resources available on http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/ to write the code.

jUnit works as expected when ran from intelliJ.

Couldn't make the application run by command line with values by user. Needs to be checked.

##HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
Please use your IDE to run the RomanNumberTest.java file inside src/com/romannumeral after importing the project.
